        <p class="blog-post-content">
            In data science, the algorithms that often gain popularity are those that are easy to explain and have obvious applications. But in the spotlight on “popular” methods, some of the most fundamental building blocks are quietly overlooked.
            Take Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), for example. Many data scientists work with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and can explain it confidently—but surprisingly few realize that PCA itself is built on top of SVD. I was in that same position for a long time, until I dug deeper and discovered just how elegant and powerful SVD really is.
            In this blog, I’ll walk through the mathematics behind SVD and explore why it’s far more than just a background concept—it’s a tool with wide-ranging applications in data science.
